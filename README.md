# USA Census-Data---Predicting-Income
In this project, I worked on the "Census Income" data set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository that contains the income information for over 48,000 individuals taken from the 1994 US census.

## Problem Statement

In this project, initially I will need to preprocess the data and then develop an understanding of different features of the data by perfoming exploratory analysis and creating vizualizations . Further, after having sufficient knowledge about the attributes I will perform a predictive task of classification to predict whether an individual makes over 50k a year or less, by using different Machine Learning  Algorithms. Specifically, I will perform the following takss:
1. Data Preprocessing: I will identify and handle missing values as follow:
    a. Replace all the missing values with N/A
    b. Remove all the rows that contain NA values
    c. Remove all white spaces from columns
 2. Data Manipulation, in this phase, I perform data manipulation to analyze the data set using various functions from the dplyr package.
 3. Data Visualization, here I will build several vizualisation including Bar-plot, Histogram, scatter-plot, using the ggplot2 library
 4. Buid different models to predict income in USA based on the Census Income dataset. Models will include:simple Linear Regression, simple logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest
